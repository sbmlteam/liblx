liblx build instructions

Mac
===

1. install swig e.g. brew install swig
2. install check (unit testing library for C) - e.g. brew install check  -> /usr/local/Cellar/check/0.15.2/
3. git clone https://github.com/sbmlteam/liblx.git    (in a suitable directory).
In my case, it creates /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/ when I do this command in /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/
4. cd liblx
5. mkdir build   -  the results of the build will be in here.
6. cd build
7. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -DWITH_CHECK=TRUE -G "Unix Makefiles" /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/
Note that the directory at the end of the cmake command above is the top-level directory of the cloned repo (i.e. it contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file).
8. make
9. invoke test script In my build subdir, it is src/liblx/xml/test/test_sbml_xml
On Mac, this builds build/src/liblx-static.a and build/src/liblx.dylib

To build the documentation
==========================
add `-DWITH_DOXYGEN=ON` to the `cmake` command.
Need Sphinx and Doxygen installed.
??? brew install sphinx-doc  # to /usr/local/opt/sphinx-doc/bin
??? or pip install -U sphinx   -> sphinx-build --version = "sphinx-build 4.0.2"
brew install doxygen   # e.g. to /usr/local/bin/doxygen
pip install breathe # see https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
pip show breathe -> /Users/matthewgillman/repos/Deviser/deviser/generator/pytest_files/cbl-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/breathe

If you need to have sphinx-doc first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sphinx-doc/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/matthewgillman/.bash_profile
can use copasi cmake module FindSphinx.cmake
cmake -DWITH_DOXYGEN=ON -DDOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/doxygen ..

-- Found Doxygen: /usr/local/bin/doxygen (found version "1.9.1") found components: doxygen missing components: dot
The dot is from graphviz, which can be used by Doxygen to draw inheritance diagrams etc
