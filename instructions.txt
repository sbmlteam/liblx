How to build the liblx libraries.

Tim:
I’d create a build sub-directory in that directory, and run CMake after cding into there.
that’s where all the results of the build process will end up. This is called an out-of-source build.
You could run CMake from the top-level directory, but you would end up with all the build files and final
binaries mixed in with the source files. This is generally a bad thing

Instructions for building on a Mac.
==================================

1. install swig e.g. brew install swig
2. install check (unit testing library for C) - e.g. brew install check  -> /usr/local/Cellar/check/0.15.2/
3. git clone https://github.com/sbmlteam/liblx.git    (in a suitable directory).
In my case, it creates /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/ when I do this command in /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/
4. cd liblx
5. mkdir build   -  the results of the build will be in here.
6. cd build
7. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -DWITH_CHECK=TRUE -G "Unix Makefiles" /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/
Note that the directory at the end of the cmake command above is the top-level directory of the cloned repo (i.e. it contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file).
8. make
9. invoke test script In my build subdir, it is src/liblx/xml/test/test_sbml_xml
On Mac, this builds build/src/liblx-static.a and build/src/liblx.dylib


If you do a build with the extra switch -DWITH_PYTHON=TRUE, you should find Python bindings generated in the build directory,
in src/bindings/python. Frank: you should find the libsbml.py (or libsbml2.py / libsbml3.py since we still support both
versions). along with a native library _libsbml.pyd|so|dylib. At that point you can change into the directory, export
the PYTHONPATH variable to the current path, and you can import libsbml with the configured python interpreter.
you can run ctest to check all tests pass.

git clean can remove untracked files e.g. those generated by CMake - need to clean these out before
each CMake build
e.g.
git clean -d -x -f -n  # check what you will delete
git clean -d -x -f
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DWITH_PYTHON=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON -DWITH_CHECK=TRUE -G "Unix Makefiles" /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/
make

To get the SWIG/Python bindings built, it appears we must download the Xerces distribution.
Because various Xerces files in src/liblx/xml #include files from there.
LibXML appears to be fully present already
Instructions at http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/XML-Xerces-C.html
> cd ~
> mkdir xerces && cd xerces
http://xml.apache.org/xerces-c/download.cgi
e.g.:
> wget https://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.apache.org//xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.2.3.tar.gz
> shasum *.gz   # check the output is the same as on the xerces website download page
> tar -xzf xerces-c-3.2.3.tar.gz
> cd xerces-c-3.2.3
> ./configure --prefix=/opt
> make
> sudo make install
The include files are now in  /opt/include/xercesc, new applications in /opt/bin, and libraries in /opt/lib
This will install development files such as include header files and libraries in "/opt" so compiler flags and linker flags are required:

    Compiler flags: -I/opt/include         CXXFLAGS
    Linker flags: -L/opt/lib -lxerces-c    LDFLAGS
try: cmake command as above but with -I/opt/include -L/opt/lib -lxerces-c
should be able to do this:
cmake ... -DWITH_XERCES=TRUE  (or -DWITH_EXPAT or -DWITH_LIBXML)
actually WITH_LIBXML is ON by default, so would need cmake ... -DWITH_XERCES=TRUE -DWITH_LIBXML=FALSE (or ON/OFF)

NB at the moment Expat and Xerces builds are failing as they still have some SBML stuff e.g. LIBSBML_CPP_NAMESPACE_END

example of variables:
${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} = /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/src
${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR} = /Users/matthewgillman/repos/libLX/liblx/build/src



====================
Basic SWIG/Python example

From https://github.com/swig/swig/wiki/FAQ#shared-libraries:
(Mac OS X section)
swig -python example.i
cc -c `python-config --cflags` example.c example_wrap.c
cc -bundle `python-config --ldflags` example.o example_wrap.o -o _example.so

http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Python.html
 Using setup.py works using Python 3.x virtual envt:
(example.i, example.c and setup.py already exist)
> swig -python example.i  # generates example.py and example_wrap.c
> python setup.py build_ext --inplace  # generates build dir and _example.cpython-36m-darwin.so

Example of how to use the SWIG/Python binding
Still in the `/build` directory
`export PYTHONPATH=.:src/bindings/python`

python
>>> from liblx import *
>>> test_str = "<annotation>\n" + "  <test xmlns=\"http://test.org/\" id=\"test1\">test2</test>\n" + "</annotation>"
>>> y = XMLNode(test_str)
>>> print(y.toString())
<annotation>
  <test xmlns="http://test.org/" id="test1">test2</test>
</annotation>
>>> z = y.clone()
>>> print(z)
<liblx.XMLNode; proxy of <Swig Object of type 'XMLNode_t *' at 0x7fe15437d870> >
>>> print(z.toString())
<annotation>
  <test xmlns="http://test.org/" id="test1">test2</test>
</annotation>
>>> y == z
False
>>> y is z
False
>>> y.toString() == z.toString()
True
>>> y.equals(z)
True
>>> z.equals(y)
True
>>> print(y.toXMLString())

Building with the Expat XML library
===================================
I don't think one has to install expat.

Include the following in the `cmake` command:

`-DWITH_EXPAT=TRUE -DWITH_LIBXML=FALSE`


### NB have we got all the C++ XML interface exported to Python?  ????

=======
Note that the directory at the end of the cmake command above is the top-level directory of the cloned repo (i.e.
it contains the top-level CMakeLists.txt file).
8. make
9. invoke test script In my build subdir, it is src/liblx/xml/test/test_sbml_xml

On Mac, this builds build/src/liblx-static.a and build/src/liblx.dylib


Then:
Sarah: get libLX to build and then work as a dependency lib with the toy example I made
 https://github.com/skeating/testsbxml/branches. Then look at SWIG for libLX.

=======
To build the documentation
==========================
add `-DWITH_DOXYGEN=ON` to the `cmake` command.
Need Sphinx and Doxygen installed.
??? brew install sphinx-doc  # to /usr/local/opt/sphinx-doc/bin
??? or pip install -U sphinx   -> sphinx-build --version = "sphinx-build 4.0.2"
brew install doxygen   # e.g. to /usr/local/bin/doxygen
pip install breathe # see https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html
pip show breathe -> /Users/matthewgillman/repos/Deviser/deviser/generator/pytest_files/cbl-env/lib/python3.6/site-packages/breathe

If you need to have sphinx-doc first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/sphinx-doc/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/matthewgillman/.bash_profile
can use copasi cmake module FindSphinx.cmake
cmake -DWITH_DOXYGEN=ON -DDOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/doxygen ..

-- Found Doxygen: /usr/local/bin/doxygen (found version "1.9.1") found components: doxygen missing components: dot
The dot is from graphviz, which can be used by Doxygen to draw inheritance diagrams etc
